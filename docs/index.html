							<p class="card-text">
								We are a company that charges insane prices for pretty
								awesome tech, so maybe it's justified. We are very
								concerned with the ecosystem, that's why we don't
								include chargers nor earphones with our phones (but we
								change the charger port each year so you still need to
								buy a new charger). What else... Let us think, Â¡Aha!
								While we do care about environment, we don't care so
								much for the workers in the factories, they have it
								pretty bad. Our software is awesome though, and we have
								this ecosystem that ties everything toghether. Our
								products work seamlessly with one another, no one else
								can do that. The ecosystem also has a nice side-effect,
								once in you cannot get out.

														This our money cow if you wish. People
														cannot seem to stop buying the iPhone even
														though we just change the corners from
														round, to square and back again to round.
														It's amazing. We also create things that
														just work with iPhone (you now, for that
														ecosystem lock). Those things were not
														necessary in the first place, so we forced
														it a little bit. For example, remember the
														Jack 3.5mm connector, we removed so we could
														sell the AirPods for an extra 150$. But, on
														the other hand, iPhone works amazingly, it's
														fast, it's cool and it gets updates more
														than any other device. AirPods, although
														expensive are really convinient and we made
														a billion market from it.

															This is just a bigger iPad. No, just
															kidding. MacBooks are pretty awesome, they
															are UNIX based, which cannot be said about
															PC. This helps developers. For
															non-developers (a.k.a. muggles) it also
															brings a cohesive UI/UX experience and again
															works seamlessly with all products. This
															UI/UX cohesiviness sometimes goes too far.
															For example, we made a useless keyboard and
															an overheating computer in 2019 trying to
															make the laptop smaller. We also started
															developing our own chips in-house which has
															made Intel very mad.
